# Improving Inventory Visibility for AEC Businesses

## Problem Statement
AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) businesses often struggle with low net margins due to a lack of visibility over their inventory. This "black box" inventory leads to:
- **Dead Inventory**: Capital tied up in materials that are not moving.
- **Stockouts**: Delays in projects because critical materials are unavailable.
- **Damaged/Expired Goods**: Materials deteriorating due to poor tracking.

## Proposed Solutions

To address these challenges, I propose a three-pronged approach combining Technology, Data Analysis, and Process Improvement.

### 1. Digital Inventory Tracking System (Tech Solution)
**The Core Problem**: Current inventory tracking is likely manual (pen and paper) or scattered across disconnected spreadsheets.

**The Solution**: Implement a centralized, cloud-based Inventory Management System (IMS).
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: A single view showing total stock value, low stock items, and recent movements.
- **Mobile Entry**: dedicated tablet or mobile interface for warehouse staff to log items immediately upon arrival or dispatch.
- **QR/Barcode Integration**: Each SKU gets a unique code. Scanning ensures 100% accuracy in logging.

**Impact**:
- Eliminates specific data entry errors.
- Provides owners with instant visibility into what they have *right now*.

### 2. Smart Reorder Points & Alerts (Data Solution)
**The Core Problem**: Businesses order too much (fear of running out) or too little (forgetting to order).

**The Solution**: Define "Min/Max" thresholds for every SKU.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Automatic notifications (Email/SMS) when stock dips below the safety stock level.
- **Dead Stock tagging**: The system flags items that haven't moved in X days (e.g., 90 days), prompting a discount sale or disposal strategy.

**Impact**:
- Reduces holding costs by preventing overstocking.
- Prevents project delays by ensuring critical items are always available.

### 3. Standardized SKU & Bin Location (Process Solution - Non-Tech)
**The Core Problem**: Even with software, if the physical warehouse is disorganized, the data will be wrong ("Garbage In, Garbage Out").

**The Solution**:
- **Standardized Naming**: Adopt a strict naming convention (e.g., `CAT-MAT-DIM-VAR` -> `TILE-CERAMIC-60x60-BEIGE`).
- **Bin Locating**: Physiaclly label every shelf and bin. The system must know not just *how much* we have, but *where* it is (e.g., Aisle 3, Shelf B).

**Impact**:
- Reduces "search time" for staff.
- Makes physical audits significantly faster.

## Conclusion
While technology (the IMS) provides the *capability* to track inventory, the value comes from the *data* (alerts/analytics) and the *process* (standardization). The implementation in Part 2 will focus on the **Digital Inventory Tracking System** to provide the foundational visibility required to solve these problems.
